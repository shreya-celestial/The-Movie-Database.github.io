npm init            //creates package.json
npm install         //node_modules
npm install eslint --save-dev       //installation
npm init @eslint/config     //creates eslint config file
"lint": "eslint ./js/*"     //add this to scripts of package.json and point to the folder where js files are there(for eg. here I've pointed to all the files in the folder names js)
npm run lint        //can use this cmd to check files after addind the above cmd
create an .eslintignore file if your folder have other files too


"lintFixer": "eslint --fix ./js/*"              //you can add this to scripts of package.json and point to the folder where js files are there(for eg. here I've pointed to all the files in the folder names js) and then can use the script cmd directly to make fixes to your files. The cmd for the same is as belows:
npm run lintFixer       //after setting the above script can run this cmd to fix all the eslint warning bugs


npx eslint --fix ./js/*         //can also use this cmd to fix the warnings and point to the folder where js files are there(for eg. here I've pointed to all the files in the folder names js)
